Audio and video
------------------------------


Audio and video in javascript, are, surpringsingly easy. Sort of.

Audio
------------------------------

In order to use audio in javascript one needs to have the audio loaded in at runtime, or via an audio tag.
Either way, one needs to be using the correct format for that browser. [Check a website](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_audio.asp) to figure out what format is supported by the browsers you are targeting. As of writing this, there is **not one 'winning' format**. Instead, you will probably need to use a combination of mp3/wav to hit all browers.

Well then, the Audio Tag
------------------------------

Getting sound into our web pages isn't too hard, use the audio tag

```
<audio id="myAudio">
  <source src="horse.wav" type="audio/wav">
  <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
```

Playing a sound
----------------------------

```
var myAudio = document.getElementById('myAudio');
myAudio.play();
```

Listening for sound events
----------------------------

There's more to life than mouse events.
Let's listen for when a sound ends:

```
myAudio.addEventListener('ended', function(event) {
	//Sound is over.
})
```

Changing the audio to be played
----------------------------

```
myAudio.src = "new/url/to/file.wav";
```

Audio events
----------------------------

- A few key ones
- **ended**: fires when the audio has finished playing
- **canplay**: fires when the audio is loaded enough to play
